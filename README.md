## Overview
The Supplier News Categorization system is designed to process and classify real-time supplier-related news articles. The system uses:
- **Data Scraping**: Extracts metadata such as title, date, tags, and content.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes text data for modeling.
- **Topic Modeling**: Utilizes LSI, LDA, and **BERTopic** for topic discovery and classification.
- **Real-time Updates**: Ensures that news articles are categorized as they are received.

This system aims to provide stakeholders with actionable insights to address supplier risks efficiently.
